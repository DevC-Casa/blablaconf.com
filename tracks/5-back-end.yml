  - title: The majestic monolith or a microservices architecture?
    description: "I'm here not to convince you to use a monolith architecture in your next project! I'm just here to give you an overall view of when to build your next project using a monolith architecture and when to choose Micro/services-oriented architecture.
I want this talk to answer the following questions :
Why some companies, like Shopify, are still using monolith architecture?
What is the modular monolith?
When to go from a monolith to microservices?
When starting a new project what to choose for my architecture?
What software architects said about monolith vs microservices?
A bit about the role of Rails in building a reputation for monolith apps."
