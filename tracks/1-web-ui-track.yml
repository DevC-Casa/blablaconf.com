  - title: "Demystifying  state management in Angular with NgRx."
    youtubeLink: "https://youtu.be/8gU5G7PfTcs?t=6928"
    description:
      "Many frontend developers especially those new to large production apps have difficulties  with the different concepts involved in state management in their applications. this workshop is entry point to most of these concepts. It is structured in a way that explains the concept in a couple of slides, followed by code snippets, and finally a code demo. Depending on the available time there could be a hands-on coding challenge for the audience.
      The programme looks something like the following;
      Introduction ::
      - state management in frontend applications.
      - Redux in a nutshell.
      Core ::
      - Deep dive into NgRx store, actions, reducers, selectors and effects.
      - Code demo: flight tracker application.

      Developers will get the most of the deep dive part of the talk if they are already familiar with Angular and have deployed at least one app to production.

      The first part (introduction) could be of use to beginner frontend developers regardless of the framework of libraries they use."
