  - title: Building smarter app empowered with Machine Learning
    description:
      "What if your apps could solve problems, deduce information from pictures and solve complex tasks? In the future, mobile apps will be so much more than a data displaying device. Using AI, apps will be able to answer complex problems at a whole new level!
      In this session, I'll  show you how to get started building apps with Xamarin powered by Machine Learning. and  how you can use services in the cloud, like Azure Cognitive Services, but also how you can use trained models locally on mobile devices using CoreML and Tensorflow."

  - title: Natural Language Processing In a Nutshell
    description: "In order to be able to cooperate or even cohabit with the machines, it is necessary to be able to communicate with them. NLP is a set of interesting methods allowing machines to understand our language as humans. How can the machine understand that you are sad, happy, or angry based on your words? Well, let's see that together."

        "Hello, I am OUSSAMA TOUIL a Computer Science Student and Android Developer. A student with a technological university degree in computer science.
        Within my establishment, I was able to create two clubs (Technology Next level TNL and Data Science & Artficial Intelligence DSAI) which is interested in computing and we were able to organize many events also online (During confinement), Events where information sharing and learning is our goal. It was about Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence, Data Science, Web Development, Mobile Development, Cyber Security, ....
        In fact, I have experiences, since I have already made two Android Mobile applications, one for My end of studies' project and the second for End of study internship. In addition to that, I have other experiences in developing Web applications (HTML5, CSS3, PHP7, MySQL ....)

        Skills/Interests: Java , C++, VB.NET, RSA Cryptology, Git, Machine Learning, PostMan API Testing."
